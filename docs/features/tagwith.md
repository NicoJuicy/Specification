# TagWith

The `TagWith` feature allows you to add a comment to the SQL query generated by [EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/tags). This is useful for debugging, tracing, or identifying queries in logs and database monitoring tools. The tag is included as a SQL comment in the generated query, making it easier to correlate queries with application code or user actions.

Compatible with the following providers:
- [EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/tags)
- EF6 - not supported

The following example shows how to add `TagWith` to a specification:

```csharp
public class CustomerSpec : Specification<Customer>
{
    public CustomerSpec(string name)
    {
        Query.Where(x => x.Name == name)
             .TagWith($"This is my customer query.");
    }
}
```

**Note:**
- You can call `TagWith` multiple times; each call adds a new tag (comment) to the query in the order they are specified.
- Tags are visible in the generated SQL as comments, but do not affect query execution.
